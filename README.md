# `libwyzyrdry`

This is a library I use for personal items I find myself having to implement
often in C projects.

# Usage

Run `cmake .` and then `make`.

Run `bin/test` to run the tests as an example.

Add the artifact `target/libwyzyrdry.a` to your compilation search path and the
contents of `include/` to your include search path. Accomplish this however you
so choose.
